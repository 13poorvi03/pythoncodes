# pythoncodes

This repository is a personal journey of learning Python, building projects, and gradually exploring the world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
It starts with beginner-friendly Python programs and small projects like calculators, expense trackers, and web apps, then moves into data structures, algorithms, and intermediate applications.
Over time, the focus will shift toward ML models, data visualization, and AI concepts, with experiments and mini research projects documented here.
The goal of this repo is not only to track progress but also to showcase growth as a developer, problem solver, and AI enthusiast.
Each project will include clear descriptions, usage instructions, and learnings, making this repository both a portfolio and a learning diary. 
Ultimately, this space reflects the vision of becoming a versatile developer who blends technical skills with creativity, building impactful projects while mastering Python, ML, and AI step by step.
